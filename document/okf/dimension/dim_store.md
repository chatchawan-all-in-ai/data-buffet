# What it is

Warehouse (คลัง) dimension built from `validated_mac5.sto`. `StoreGroup` is the MAC5 warehouse group code (`sto.stogroup`) and `ReportStore` is the report slicer that keeps the groups KK, LP, HY, UB and PK and collapses every other group into one bucket named KTB. The three store-grain facts `fact_order_store`, `fact_invoice_store` and `fact_backlog_store` join it through `milSto` / `cpsSto`.

Read by: [fact_backlog_store](/fact/fact_backlog_store.md), [fact_invoice_store](/fact/fact_invoice_store.md), [fact_order_store](/fact/fact_order_store.md).

# Grain and key

One row = one warehouse. Natural key: (`companyID`, `StoreCode`). `StoreSK` is retained for a matching key; new keys are allocated after the current maximum. Rows absent from the complete source snapshot are removed.

# Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `StoreSK` | INT64 | Stable surrogate key for the natural key; new keys are allocated after the current maximum. |
| `CompanySK` | INT64 | Surrogate key of the company, from [dim_company](/dimension/dim_company.md) joined on CompanyID; NULL if no match. NULL on the -1 row. |
| `companyID` | STRING | Company code, from `sto.company_id`; NULL on the -1 row. |
| `StoreCode` | STRING | Warehouse code; NULL on the -1 row. |
| `StoreGroup` | STRING | Warehouse group code (`sto.stogroup`); NULL on the -1 row. |
| `StoreNameT` | STRING | Thai name of the warehouse; 'ไม่ระบุคลัง' on the -1 row. |
| `StoreNameE` | STRING | English name of the warehouse; 'Unknown' on the -1 row. |
| `ReportStore` | STRING | Report slicer: `StoreGroup` as is when its lower-case value is one of kk, pk, lp, ub, hy; otherwise (including NULL group) the bucket 'KTB'. The -1 row is 'KTB'. |
# How it is built

- Definition: `definitions/dimension/dim_store.sqlx` (`type: "operations"`, `hasOutput: true`, tags `dimension_daily`).
- Reads: [validated_mac5.sto](/validated/validated_mac5/sto.md), [dimension_table.dim_company](/dimension/dim_company.md).
- Stable-key sync from a complete source snapshot; matching keys retain their SK and update attributes, new rows are inserted, and absent rows are removed; runs after dim_company. The hand-written -1 row is UNION ALL'd in the same statement.
# Examples

Warehouse group slicer values and counts.

```sql
SELECT ReportStore, COUNT(*) AS stores
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.dimension_table.dim_store`
GROUP BY ReportStore
ORDER BY stores DESC;
```
