# What it is

Validated copy of CIS360 `district`: every column is trimmed/cast with the shared helpers, the extract date is standardised to `asatdate`, and duplicates are collapsed. There is no business logic at this layer. Table meaning: Lookup of Thai districts (amphoe/khet) used in CIS360 addresses.
No other repo object reads it.

# Grain and key

One row per `id`. The key is declared twice in the definition (`uniqueKey` and `pk_key`) and enforced as a `NOT ENFORCED` primary key after full builds.

# Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INT64 | Primary key of the district lookup. |
| `district_code` | STRING | 4-digit Thai district (amphoe/khet) code. |
| `district_name` | STRING | District name in Thai. |
| `district_name_en` | STRING | District name in English. |
| `province_id` | INT64 | Identifier of the parent province (`province.id`). |
| `create_date` | DATETIME | Timestamp when the record was created. |
| `create_by` | STRING | Identifier of the user or system that created the record. |
| `create_by_platform` | STRING | Code of the platform that created the record (`D365`, `ALLKONS_AMRP`, `ALLKONS_ID`, `ALLKONS_M_SELLER`, `ALLKONS_M_BUYER`, `CIS360`, `SYSTEM`). |
| `update_by_platform` | STRING | Code of the platform that last updated the record (`D365`, `ALLKONS_AMRP`, `ALLKONS_ID`, `ALLKONS_M_SELLER`, `ALLKONS_M_BUYER`, `CIS360`, `SYSTEM`). |
| `update_date` | DATETIME | Timestamp when the record was last updated. |
| `update_by` | STRING | Identifier of the user or system that last updated the record. |
| `asatdate` | DATE | Extract date (the raw ASATDATE partition parsed to DATE) of the winning row; used as the dedup tiebreaker and the partition column. |

# How it is built

- Definition: `definitions/validated/cis360/district.sqlx` (`type: "incremental"`, tags `validated`, `validated_incremental`).
- Reads: [raw_cis360.district](/initial/raw_cis360/district.md).
- **Incremental**: each run reads only raw partitions with `ASATDATE` within the last `BACKFILL_DAYS` days and MERGEs on `uniqueKey`. A first or full build reads every raw partition.
- Dedup: `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY <key> ORDER BY asatdate DESC) = 1`.
- Storage: partition by `asatdate`, cluster by `id`.

# Examples

Sample recent rows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.validated_cis360.district`
WHERE asatdate >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('Asia/Bangkok'), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
LIMIT 100
```

Duplicate keys:

```sql
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.validated_cis360.district`
GROUP BY id
HAVING n > 1
```
