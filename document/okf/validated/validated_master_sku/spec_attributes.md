# What it is

Validated copy of MASTER_SKU `spec_attributes`: every column is trimmed/cast with the shared helpers, the extract date is standardised to `asatdate`, and duplicates are collapsed. There is no business logic at this layer. Table meaning: Specification attributes (size, color, model and other product properties) available in master_sku 3.0.
No other table or view in this repository reads it.

# Grain and key

One row per `id`. The key is declared twice in the definition (`uniqueKey` and `pk_key`) and enforced as a `NOT ENFORCED` primary key after full builds.

# Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | STRING | Unique identifier (UUID) of the specification attribute. |
| `code` | STRING | Specification attribute code. |
| `name` | STRING | Specification attribute name (e.g. size, color, model). |
| `description` | STRING | Specification attribute description. |
| `status` | STRING | Record status (`Active`, `Inactive`, `Deleted`). |
| `created_at` | DATETIME | Timestamp when the record was created. |
| `created_by` | STRING | Identifier of the user who created the record. |
| `updated_at` | DATETIME | Timestamp when the record was last updated. |
| `updated_by` | STRING | Identifier of the user who last updated the record. |
| `asatdate` | DATE | Extract date (the raw ASATDATE partition parsed to DATE) of the winning row; used as the dedup tiebreaker and the partition column. |

# How it is built

- Definition: `definitions/validated/master_sku/spec_attributes.sqlx` (`type: "incremental"`, tags `validated`, `validated_incremental`).
- Reads: [raw_master_sku.spec_attributes](/initial/raw_master_sku/spec_attributes.md).
- **Incremental**: each run reads only raw partitions with `ASATDATE` within the last `BACKFILL_DAYS` days (currently 1; string compare) and MERGEs on `uniqueKey`. A first or full build reads every raw partition.
- Dedup: `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY <key> ORDER BY asatdate DESC, updated_at DESC) = 1`.
- Storage: partition by `asatdate`, cluster by `id`.
- Approximate size (BigQuery metadata, 2026-10-31): 418 rows, 80.8 KB.

# Examples

Sample recent rows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.validated_master_sku.spec_attributes`
WHERE asatdate >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('Asia/Bangkok'), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
LIMIT 100
```

Duplicate keys:

```sql
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.validated_master_sku.spec_attributes`
GROUP BY id
HAVING n > 1
```
