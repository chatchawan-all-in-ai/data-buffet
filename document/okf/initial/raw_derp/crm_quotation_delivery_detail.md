# What it is

External table over AVRO files in `gs://file-raw-data/derp_temp/crm_quotation_delivery_detail/*` (Hive-partitioned by `ASATDATE=YYYYMMDD`). It is the raw landing copy of the `crm_quotation_delivery_detail` table from DERP; nothing is cleaned or deduplicated here. Table meaning: Products and quantities to deliver in each quotation delivery round. Used by: [validated_derp.crm_quotation_delivery_detail](/validated/validated_derp/crm_quotation_delivery_detail.md).

# Grain and key

One row per source record **per ASATDATE partition**: the same business record appears again in every day's extract (full snapshots) or only when it changed (incremental feeds), depending on the source. There is no key at this layer; the validated table defines the key and keeps the newest `asatdate` per key.

# Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `quotation_delivery_detail_id` | STRING | UUID of the delivery round line. |
| `quotation_delivery_id` | STRING | UUID of the delivery round in `crm_quotation_delivery`. |
| `quotation_id` | STRING | UUID of the quotation in `crm_quotation`. |
| `quotation_no` | STRING | Quotation document number (e.g. `QT2607...` or `MDT2610...`). |
| `quotation_date` | STRING | Quotation document date. |
| `product_id` | STRING | UUID of the product in the DERP product master. |
| `product_code` | STRING | Product (item) code. |
| `product_name` | STRING | Product name. |
| `qty_delivered` | INT64 | Quantity of the product to deliver in the round. |
| `created_by` | STRING | Identifier of the user who created the record. |
| `created_by_name` | STRING | Display name of the user who created the record. |
| `created_at` | STRING | Timestamp when the record was created. |
| `updated_by` | STRING | Identifier of the user who last updated the record. |
| `updated_by_name` | STRING | Display name of the user who last updated the record. |
| `updated_at` | STRING | Timestamp when the record was last updated. |
| `order_sort` | INT64 | Display order of the row within its parent record. |
| `combo_set_id` | STRING | UUID of the combo set (product bundle) the line belongs to. |
| `combo_set_code` | STRING | Code of the combo set (product bundle) the line belongs to (e.g. `COMBOSET00014`). |
| `quotation_detail_id` | STRING | UUID of the quotation line in `crm_quotation_detail`. |
| `ASATDATE` | STRING | Hive partition column (STRING `YYYYMMDD`): the extract date of the GCS folder the row came from. |

# How it is built

- Created by the Dataform operation `create_all_table_raw_derp` (`definitions/initial/derp/create_all_table_raw_derp.sqlx`, tag `initial`) with `CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE` (preceded by `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`). It is a metadata object: no data is stored in BigQuery, every query reads the GCS files.
- Format `AVRO`, URI `gs://file-raw-data/derp_temp/crm_quotation_delivery_detail/*`.
- Refresh: the extract job drops new files in the bucket; the external table sees them immediately. Dataform does not refresh it daily.

# Examples

Yesterday's extract:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.raw_derp.crm_quotation_delivery_detail`
WHERE ASATDATE = FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m%d', DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('Asia/Bangkok'), INTERVAL 1 DAY))
LIMIT 100
```

Row counts per extract day over the last week:

```sql
SELECT ASATDATE, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.raw_derp.crm_quotation_delivery_detail`
WHERE ASATDATE >= FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m%d', DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('Asia/Bangkok'), INTERVAL 7 DAY))
GROUP BY ASATDATE
ORDER BY ASATDATE
```
