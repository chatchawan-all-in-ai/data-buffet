# What it is

External table over AVRO files in `gs://file-raw-data/master_sku/spec_groups/*` (Hive-partitioned by `ASATDATE=YYYYMMDD`). It is the raw landing copy of the `spec_groups` table from MASTER_SKU; nothing is cleaned or deduplicated here. Used by: [validated_master_sku.spec_groups](/validated/validated_master_sku/spec_groups.md).

# Grain and key

One row per source record **per ASATDATE partition**: the same business record appears again in every day's extract (full snapshots) or only when it changed (incremental feeds), depending on the source. There is no key at this layer; the validated table defines the key and keeps the newest `asatdate` per key.

# Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | STRING | Source column as delivered in the file, uncleaned (meaning not documented in the repo). |
| `name` | STRING | Source column as delivered in the file, uncleaned (meaning not documented in the repo). |
| `status` | STRING | Source column as delivered in the file, uncleaned (meaning not documented in the repo). |
| `created_at` | STRING | Source column as delivered in the file, uncleaned (meaning not documented in the repo). |
| `created_by` | STRING | Source column as delivered in the file, uncleaned (meaning not documented in the repo). |
| `updated_at` | STRING | Source column as delivered in the file, uncleaned (meaning not documented in the repo). |
| `updated_by` | STRING | Source column as delivered in the file, uncleaned (meaning not documented in the repo). |
| `ASATDATE` | STRING | Hive partition column (STRING `YYYYMMDD`): the extract date of the GCS folder the row came from. |

# How it is built

- Created by the Dataform operation `create_all_table_raw_master_sku` (`definitions/initial/master_sku/create_all_table_raw_master_sku.sqlx`, tag `initial`) with `CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE` (preceded by `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`). It is a metadata object: no data is stored in BigQuery, every query reads the GCS files.
- Format `AVRO`, URI `gs://file-raw-data/master_sku/spec_groups/*`.
- Refresh: the extract job drops new files in the bucket; the external table sees them immediately. Dataform does not refresh it daily.

# Examples

Yesterday's extract:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.raw_master_sku.spec_groups`
WHERE ASATDATE = FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m%d', DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('Asia/Bangkok'), INTERVAL 1 DAY))
LIMIT 100
```

Row counts per extract day over the last week:

```sql
SELECT ASATDATE, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.raw_master_sku.spec_groups`
WHERE ASATDATE >= FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m%d', DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('Asia/Bangkok'), INTERVAL 7 DAY))
GROUP BY ASATDATE
ORDER BY ASATDATE
```
