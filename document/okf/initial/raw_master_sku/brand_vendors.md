# What it is

External table over AVRO files in `gs://file-raw-data/master_sku/brand_vendors/*` (Hive-partitioned by `ASATDATE=YYYYMMDD`). It is the raw landing copy of the `brand_vendors` table from MASTER_SKU; nothing is cleaned or deduplicated here. Table meaning: Links between master_sku brands and the vendors that supply them; products reference this link to get their vendor. Used by: [validated_master_sku.brand_vendors](/validated/validated_master_sku/brand_vendors.md).

# Grain and key

One row per source record **per ASATDATE partition**: the same business record appears again in every day's extract (full snapshots) or only when it changed (incremental feeds), depending on the source. There is no key at this layer; the validated table defines the key and keeps the newest `asatdate` per key.

# Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | STRING | Unique identifier (UUID) of the brand-vendor link. |
| `brand_id` | STRING | Brand (FK to `brands.id`). |
| `vendor_id` | STRING | Vendor that supplies the brand (FK to `vendors.id`). |
| `sort_order` | INT64 | Display order of the brand for the vendor. |
| `image_name` | STRING | File name of the brand logo image for this vendor. |
| `status` | STRING | Record status (`Active`, `Inactive`, `Deleted`). |
| `created_at` | STRING | Timestamp when the record was created. |
| `created_by` | STRING | Identifier of the user who created the record. |
| `updated_at` | STRING | Timestamp when the record was last updated. |
| `updated_by` | STRING | Identifier of the user who last updated the record. |
| `ASATDATE` | STRING | Hive partition column (STRING `YYYYMMDD`): the extract date of the GCS folder the row came from. |

# How it is built

- Created by the Dataform operation `create_all_table_raw_master_sku` (`definitions/initial/master_sku/create_all_table_raw_master_sku.sqlx`, tag `initial`) with `CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE` (preceded by `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`). It is a metadata object: no data is stored in BigQuery, every query reads the GCS files.
- Format `AVRO`, URI `gs://file-raw-data/master_sku/brand_vendors/*`.
- Refresh: the extract job drops new files in the bucket; the external table sees them immediately. Dataform does not refresh it daily.

# Examples

Yesterday's extract:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.raw_master_sku.brand_vendors`
WHERE ASATDATE = FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m%d', DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('Asia/Bangkok'), INTERVAL 1 DAY))
LIMIT 100
```

Row counts per extract day over the last week:

```sql
SELECT ASATDATE, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.raw_master_sku.brand_vendors`
WHERE ASATDATE >= FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m%d', DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('Asia/Bangkok'), INTERVAL 7 DAY))
GROUP BY ASATDATE
ORDER BY ASATDATE
```
