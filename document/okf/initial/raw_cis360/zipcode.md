# What it is

External table over AVRO files in `gs://file-raw-data/cis360/zipcode/*` (Hive-partitioned by `ASATDATE=YYYYMMDD`). It is the raw landing copy of the `zipcode` table from CIS360; nothing is cleaned or deduplicated here. Table meaning: Lookup of Thai postal codes mapped to province, district and sub-district.

Read by: [validated_cis360.zipcode](/validated/validated_cis360/zipcode.md).

# Grain and key

One row per source record **per ASATDATE partition**: the same business record appears again in every day's extract (full snapshots) or only when it changed (incremental feeds), depending on the source. There is no key at this layer; the validated table defines the key and keeps the newest `asatdate` per key.

# Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INT64 | Primary key of the postal code lookup. |
| `zipcode_code` | STRING | 5-digit Thai postal code. |
| `province_id` | INT64 | Identifier of the province (`province.id`). |
| `district_id` | INT64 | Identifier of the district (`district.id`). |
| `sub_district_id` | INT64 | Identifier of the sub-district (`sub_district.id`). |
| `create_date` | STRING | Timestamp when the record was created. |
| `create_by` | STRING | Identifier of the user or system that created the record. |
| `create_by_platform` | STRING | Code of the platform that created the record (`D365`, `ALLKONS_AMRP`, `ALLKONS_ID`, `ALLKONS_M_SELLER`, `ALLKONS_M_BUYER`, `CIS360`, `SYSTEM`). |
| `update_by_platform` | STRING | Code of the platform that last updated the record (`D365`, `ALLKONS_AMRP`, `ALLKONS_ID`, `ALLKONS_M_SELLER`, `ALLKONS_M_BUYER`, `CIS360`, `SYSTEM`). |
| `update_date` | STRING | Timestamp when the record was last updated. |
| `update_by` | STRING | Identifier of the user or system that last updated the record. |
| `ASATDATE` | STRING | Hive partition column (STRING `YYYYMMDD`): the extract date of the GCS folder the row came from. |

# How it is built

- Created by the Dataform operation `create_all_table_raw_cis360` (`definitions/initial/cis360/create_all_table_raw_cis360.sqlx`, tag `initial`) with `CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE` (preceded by `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`). It is a metadata object: no data is stored in BigQuery, every query reads the GCS files.
- Format `AVRO`, URI `gs://file-raw-data/cis360/zipcode/*`.
- Refresh: the extract job drops new files in the bucket; the external table sees them immediately. Dataform does not refresh it daily.

# Examples

Yesterday's extract:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.raw_cis360.zipcode`
WHERE ASATDATE = FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m%d', DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('Asia/Bangkok'), INTERVAL 1 DAY))
LIMIT 100
```

Row counts per extract day over the last week:

```sql
SELECT ASATDATE, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM `databuffet-nonprd.raw_cis360.zipcode`
WHERE ASATDATE >= FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m%d', DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('Asia/Bangkok'), INTERVAL 7 DAY))
GROUP BY ASATDATE
ORDER BY ASATDATE
```
